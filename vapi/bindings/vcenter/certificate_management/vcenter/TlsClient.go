    // Replaces the rhttpproxy TLS certificate with the specified certificate. This method can be used in three scenarios : 
    //
    // #. When the CSR is created and the private key is already stored, this method can replace the certificate. The certificate but not the private key and root certificate must be provided as input.
    // #. When the certificate is signed by a third party certificate authority/VMCA and the root certificate of the third party certificate authority/VMCA is already one of the trusted roots in the trust store, this method can replace the certificate and private key. The certificate and the private key but not the root certificate must be provided as input.
    // #. When the certificate is signed by a third party certificate authority and the root certificate of the third party certificate authority is not one of the trusted roots in the trust store, this method can replace the certificate, private key and root CA certificate. The certificate, private key and root certificate must be provided as input.
    //
    //  After this method completes, the services using the certificate will be restarted for the new certificate to take effect. 
    //
