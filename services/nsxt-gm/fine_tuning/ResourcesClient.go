For any type on NSX, some of the attributes of that type may be owned and set by Policy when realizing the intent, while some others may be owned and set by the enforcement point itself. This information can be used to disable updates to Policy owned attributes by the advanced networking UI, while allowing tweaking to the attributes owned by the management plane.
