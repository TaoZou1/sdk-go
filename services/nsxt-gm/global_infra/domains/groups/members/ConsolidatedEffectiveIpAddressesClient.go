type ConsolidatedEffectiveIpAddressesClient interface {

    // Returns consolidated effective ip address members of the specified NSGroup. Applicable in case of federated environment. The response contains site-wise list of consolidated effective IP address members. In the response, for the local-site, the list will contain static and dynamicaly translated IPs. For the remote sites, the list will contain only the dynamically translated IPs. The static IPs will not be seen in the response of this API. Hence, user can refer to the local-site Ip response in the API results or the group definition to see the static IP membership of the Group. This API is applicable only for Global Groups containing (directly or via nesting) either VirtualMachine, VIF, Segment, SegmentPort or IPSet member type. Use the cursor value in the response to fetch the next page. If there is no cursor value for a response, it implies the last page in the results for the query.
