    // Get a paginated aggregated configuration of a given draft. This aggregated configuration is the differnece between the current published firewall configuration and a firewall configuration stored in a given draft. For an initial API call, if request_id is present in a response, then this is a paginated aggregated configuration of a given draft, containing all the security policies from the aggregated configuration. Using this request_id, more granular aggregated configuration, at security policy level, can be fetched from subsequent API calls. Absence of request_id suggests that whole aggregated configuration has been returned as a response to initial API call, as the size of aggregated configuration is not big enough to need pagination.
